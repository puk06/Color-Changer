### 🛠 Features

- 🔁 **Global Color Change** – Apply a color shift across the entire texture.
- 🎯 **Partial Color Change** – Change only selected regions of the texture.
- 🖼️ **Transparent Image Creation** – Make only the selected area transparent.
- 🎚️ **Distance-Based Blending** – Adjust the color change strength based on color similarity.

---

This tool extracts the color difference from your initial input (e.g., "change this red to this blue") and applies the same difference across the texture, creating natural and consistent results.
